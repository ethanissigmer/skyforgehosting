            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>S.1: Doxxing</strong>
                    <p>Doxxing is strictly prohibited within SkyForge Hosting's parameters. If caught by any support staff, they will use their evidence and contact the Lead Support Staff member, and you will be banned from the hosting services and the server itself.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>S.2: Toxicity</strong>
                    <p>Toxicity IS permitted, but only to an extent. If we deem it necessary, support staff or a certain staff member will tell you to stop or verbally warn you to stop; otherwise, they will take further action on the conversation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>S.3: Advertisements</strong>
                    <p>Do NOT advertise in any sort of channels anywhere. This is strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated by any members or staff members. Please follow the guidelines and make sure you are aware of them.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>S.4: NSFW</strong>
                    <p>NSFW content is strictly prohibited, including pornography, any type of porn, gifs related to NSFW relations, and more. Please use common sense.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>S.5: Racism, Hate Speech, Drama, Excessive Swearing, Sensitive Topics</strong>
                    <p>Self-explanatory: don't be stupid.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>S.6: Impersonation</strong>
                    <p>Do not impersonate any staff, management, or foundership member. This will lead to exposure announced by us, and if we catch you, you will be exposed and muted for a 5-day period.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>S.7: Bypassing</strong>
                    <p>Bypassing certain word filters (e.g., "FCK" or the n-word but shortened) will result in a temporary mute for 20-30 minutes, depending on the severity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>S.8: Spamming</strong>
                    <p>Spamming is allowed but keep it to an excessive amount. If you're doing multiple sentences at the same time, that's allowed. If you are purely just spamming one word at a time or spamming emojis, you will be muted for a short period of time (5-10 minutes).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>S.9: Harassment</strong>
                    <p>Harassing members or staff members of any sort is NOT allowed. If you are caught doing so, you will be muted for up to a maximum of 30 minutes. Please do not harass any members, staff members, or management members, as some are busy with their own lives or other situations. Thank you.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>S.10: Channel Use</strong>
                    <p>Please use the designated channels for their correct purpose. For example, we do not allow other languages, so please use English unless it's in the international chatroom. Please use media for correct purposes such as picture-related situations or anything else related to the other channels. Media will be allowed to have free talk, so you can talk there freely if you would like.</p>
