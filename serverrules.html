    <h1>Acceptable Use Policy (Paid users)</h1>
    <p>These are the only policys that apply for paid users. (A paid user is someone who has spent money on a server, Free credits and Free Trials dont count.)</p>
    <h3>Common disallowed actions/software to avoid includes but is not limited to:</h3>
    <p>- Anything illegal under EU, US or Oregon law (DDoS tools, Child pornography, Copyrighted content, Vulnerability scanning, Email Bombers, etc.)<br>
    - Any activity which causes service interruptions to either SkyForge Hosting's network/servers or any outside network. This
    includes, but is not limited to, the execution of Denial of Service attacks or other maliciously configured software.<br>
    - Using a bug with the Disk/CPU/RAM limits to cause your usage to go over the limit you are supposed to have.
    <br>- Do not create multiple accounts.
</p><br><br><br><br>

    <h1>Acceptable Use Policy (Free users)</h1>
    <p>This only applies to free servers, We have a separate policy for our free users becuase they are sharing one node and are commonly used for abuse.</p>
    <h3>Common disallowed actions/software to avoid includes but is not limited to:</h3>
    <p>- Everything from the paid user policy<br>
      - Registered email can recieve and send emails from at all times (no temp mails, relays).<br>
      - CPU/RAM/Disk filling tools (Crypto miners, Complex equations that uses a large amount of resources for a long period of time)<br>
      - Breaking 3rd party TOS (As an example if your bot needs an API following the API's TOS)<br>
      - Do not host proxys/VPNs.<br>
      - Be active at least once every 28 days (manage files, login + visit account page, do a power action).<br>
